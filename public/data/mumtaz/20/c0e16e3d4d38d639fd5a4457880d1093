Currently, the role property in the machine can assume master, remote and hypervisor roles. However I can case of MEMF, the machine can have a dual role. For instance, consider a hypothetical 3 core system with each machine assigned one core. The machine A brings up machine B which in turn starts machine C. The machine B has the dual role in this case. The role property in\u00a0 the machine node is used to selectively copy the master\/remote properties from the remoteproc and rpmsg nodes to output artifacts. Adding the new role to machine will not scale for \u00a0system with multiple machines having dual role. For one dual role machine, you can see the remotpeorc\/rpmsg device referred by the other machine and check its role and based on that assume role of current\u00a0 machine. However, it will break for multiple dual role machines. I think if we attach role attribute the \u00a0to handle then we can handle this case, something like remoteproc1 = <&remoteproc0 \u201cmaster\u201d>-; \n\n # -Generate embedded_images.c for each master machine. Currently, only one embedded_images.c is generated. For the use case listed above we will need this file for machines A and B.\u00a0 We should generate this file each master machine.- \n\n # Remove the restriction which prevents simultaneous use of the RPMSG and Remoteproc nodes. Both nodes can be used at the same time.-\n\n\u00a0\n\nPlease let me when you can take up this work and expected time lines. Thanks in advance!\n\n\u00a0Thanks,\n\nEtsam Anjum","issuelinks":[{"id":"169623","self":"http:\/\/jira.alm.mentorg.com:8080\/rest\/api\/2\/issueLink\/169623","type":{"id":"10130","name":"Implements","inward":"implements","outward":"implemented by","self":"http:\/\/jira.alm.mentorg.com:8080\/rest\/api\/2\/issueLinkType\/10130"},"inwardIssue":{"id":"204271","key":"CB-9023","self":"http:\/\/jira.alm.mentorg.com:8080\/rest\/api\/2\/issue\/204271","fields":{"summary":"Add support for chain topology in sysgen tooling for Analogic","status":{"self":"http:\/\/jira.alm.mentorg.com:8080\/rest\/api\/2\/status\/5","description":"A resolution has been taken, and it is awaiting verification by reporter.

I am using\nNucluesR5-NucleusR5-Nucleus-A53-MELA53 template from zynqmp-zcu102-r5\nbsp present in memf-analogic branch.\n2- Tool does not add num_firmwares and fw_name properties in machine\nfiles for remote, it only adds these for master. which is the expected\nbehavior. We need these properties in case of dual role, only in the\nmaster's remoteproc node.
