A fictitious new ACME 4.0.0 BSP not included in the ReadyStart installation (it is simply a renamed copy of the latest sabre_lite BSP).\r\n2. A 4.1.0 version of the  fvp_cortex_r52 BSP.  Since this is a 4.1.0 version that will install side by side with one included in the ReadyStart installation, you should see two (4.1.0 and 4.0.0).\r\n3. A 4.0.1 version of the sabre_lite BSP.  Since this is an update to the one included in the ReadyStart installation, you should only see the 4.0.1 version.\r\nExtract the readystart-arm-windows-x64-4.0.0 installer and edit the installer.properties, changing\r\n{noformat}\r\neclipse.p2.repos=jar:file:.\/repos\/jre.zip!\/,jar:file:.\/repos\/install.zip!\/,${eclipse.p2.repos.mirror}\/nucleus\/4.0\/arm\/update\r\n{noformat}\r\nto\r\n{noformat}\r\neclipse.p2.repos=jar:file:.\/repos\/jre.zip!\/,jar:file:.\/repos\/install.zip!\/,${eclipse.p2.repos.mirror}\/nucleus\/4.0.qa\/arm\/update\r\n{noformat}\r\nso that the test update site is used.\r\n\r\n1.

Run the readystart-arm-windows-x64-4.0.0, select to 'Check online for updates', and change the existing installation.\r\n3. Notice ACME and fvp_cortex_r52 (4.1.0) will be deselected by default since they are not installed and sabre_lite will be selected (since it is installed) and marked to upgrade.\r\n4. Select the ACME BSP, but deselect fvp_cortex_r52 and sabre_lite.  Proceed with installation.\r\n5. Notice that ACME BSP is installed and sabre_lite is *upgraded* even though it was not selected.\r\n\r\nNormally, in a change install, any optional components installed will be selected and any optional components not installed will be deselected.  Selecting a component will add it to the installation and deselecting a component will remove it from the installation.\r\nIn this case, the component is already installed but will be upgraded.  Deselecting it definitely should not upgrade it but should probably also not remove it (since it is an upgrade).  Currently, it looks to upgrade it (and not remove) regardless if it is selected or deselected.","issuelinks":[{"id":"206435","self":"http:\/\/jira.alm.mentorg.com:8080\/rest\/api\/2\/issueLink\/206435","type":{"id":"10130","name":"Implements","inward":"implements","outward":"implemented by","self":"http:\/\/jira.alm.mentorg.com:8080\/rest\/api\/2\/issueLinkType\/10130"},"inwardIssue":{"id":"226263","key":"CB-10143","self":"http:\/\/jira.alm.mentorg.com:8080\/rest\/api\/2\/issue\/226263","fields":{"summary":"Allow Nucleus Installer to get BSPs from the Web","status":{"self":"http:\/\/jira.alm.mentorg.com:8080\/rest\/api\/2\/status\/5","description":"A resolution has been taken, and it is awaiting verification by reporter.
