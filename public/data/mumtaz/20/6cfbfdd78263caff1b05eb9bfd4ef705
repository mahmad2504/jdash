(Basically following the CB platform version)\r\n  b- PRODUCT: A module can use the version of the product being built. Should only be used for modules that are exclusive to a particular product, and shouldn't be used for any module that can be built with multiple products. \r\nActually should only be used for modules that specify branding information.\r\nsomething like nu_installer.py fits here as this module contains Nucleus specific installer, and we want to use Nucleus branding version rather than CB version.\r\nruntime_ide may fit there, but it contains plugins for Nucleus, MEMF and MEHV, so would be a bit hard to depend on the product version, and most likely will need to have product-independent version\r\n  c- CUSTOM: A module can supply its own version that doesn't follow the CB platform, or the product being built.\r\n\r\nOne problem with this approach is that a module can have references to other modules, like references to common settings in cb_releng, or an installer module pointing to other IU versions.\r\nA way to fix this is to extend the Modes to the versions being replaced, for example:\r\na 1.0.0 version is replaced based on the version supplied by the module.\r\na 7.7.7 version will always follow the branch version\r\na 9.9.9  version will always follow the product version\r\n\r\nNote: The possible solutions are not exclusive, they are complimentary, and each module can decide what it needs.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n[~mbozeman] [~tmirza]","issuelinks":[{"id":"196561","self":"http:\/\/jira.alm.mentorg.com:8080\/rest\/api\/2\/issueLink\/196561","type":{"id":"10130","name":"Implements","inward":"implements","outward":"implemented by","self":"http:\/\/jira.alm.mentorg.com:8080\/rest\/api\/2\/issueLinkType\/10130"},"inwardIssue":{"id":"222096","key":"CB-9846","self":"http:\/\/jira.alm.mentorg.com:8080\/rest\/api\/2\/issue\/222096","fields":{"summary":"Change Release Name\/Versioning Scheme for ReadyStart","status":{"self":"http:\/\/jira.alm.mentorg.com:8080\/rest\/api\/2\/status\/5","description":"A resolution has been taken, and it is awaiting verification by reporter.
